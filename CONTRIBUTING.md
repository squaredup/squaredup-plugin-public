Help us keep SquaredUp Samples open and inclusive.
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## <a name="question"></a> Got a question?

Please do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and requests. 

Please use [SquaredUp Community Answers](https://community.squaredup.com) to ask questions. The forums provide

* direct access to many people with extensive experience with SquaredUp
* public viewing so your question and its answer can help someone else
* central location where you and others can search for previously asked questions and answers

## <a name="problem"></a>Found a problem?
If you find a bug or a problem, you can help us by:

* [Submit an support ticket](https://docs.squaredup.com/submit-ticket) with as much information as possible.
* Even better, create a Pull Request with a fix!

## <a name="request"></a> Suggesting features and ideas
Is there a plugin you need, but aren't able to develop? Does a plugin need an enhancement? Then [submit a feedback](https://feedback.squaredup.com/plugins), please provide lots of details to help us build it!

## <a name="contribute"></a>Contributing enhancements and plugins
If there is an enhancement you want to make to an existing plugin or a cool new plugin you want to contribute then please submit a Pull Request with your work.

### <a name="submit"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Read the [documentation](README.md) and explore the existing plugins for best practice guidance.
3. For creating pull requests see - [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
4. Make sure you pull request is appropriately described, and contains all the required files and documentation for review.

That's it, thank you for your contribution! :+1:
